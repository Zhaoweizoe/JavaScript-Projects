        <p>An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

            A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.
            It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" 
            in place (like position:fixed).
            
            Note: Internet Explorer, Edge 15 and earlier versions do not support sticky positioning. 
            Safari requires a -webkit- prefix (see example below). You must also specify at least one of top, right, 
            bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.</p>
